This repository contains of [Angular de cero a experto: (Angular 17+)](https://www.udemy.com/course/angular-fernando-herrera/) projects. Also contains a bunch of small projects that i made to practice the topics of Angular.

## Angular Roadmap.

Angular is a widely-used open-source web application framework developed and maintained by Google. It's designed to simplify the development and testing of single-page applications (SPAs) by providing a structured framework for organizing code, implementing data binding, handling events, and managing the flow of data between components. Angular uses TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript, and follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern to create dynamic and responsive web applications. It includes a range of features and tools for building robust, scalable, and maintainable front-end applications.

### Temary.

**1. Prerequisites**:

-   HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: Ensure you have a good understanding of these fundamental web technologies.
-   TypeScript: Angular is built with TypeScript, so it's essential to learn the basics of TypeScript, including its syntax and features.

**2. Basic Concepts**:

-   Understand the MVC Architecture: Learn about Angular's Model-View-Controller architecture and how it organizes code.
-   Components and Directives: Gain a solid understanding of Angular components and directives.
-   Templates and Data Binding: Learn how to create templates and bind data between the component and the view.

**3. Getting Started**:

-   Angular CLI: Familiarize yourself with the Angular CLI to create, build, and manage Angular projects.
-   Create Your First App: Follow tutorials to create a simple Angular application to understand the basics.

**4. Deepen Your Knowledge**:

-   Services and Dependency Injection: Learn how to create services and use dependency injection for sharing data and functionality.
-   Modules: Understand how to use Angular modules to organize and structure your application.

**5. Routing**:

-   Angular Router: Learn how to implement navigation in your application using the Angular Router.

**6. Forms**:

-   Template-Driven Forms: Start with template-driven forms to handle user input.
-   Reactive Forms: Progress to reactive forms for more control and complex scenarios.

**7. HTTP and Observables**:

-   HttpClient: Learn how to make HTTP requests in Angular using the HttpClient module.
-   Observables: Understand the role of observables in Angular and how they facilitate handling asynchronous operations.

**8. State Management**:

-   NgRx (Optional): Explore state management with NgRx if you're working on larger applications.

**9. Testing**:

-   Unit Testing: Learn to write unit tests for your Angular components and services.
-   End-to-End Testing: Explore tools like Protractor for end-to-end testing.

**10. Advanced Concepts**:

-   Directives: Explore more advanced directives in Angular.
-   Pipes: Understand how to use pipes for data transformation in templates.

**11. Deployment**:

-   Deploy Your App: Learn how to deploy your Angular application to different hosting environments.

Angular CLI (Command Line Interface): A command-line tool that helps developers scaffold, build, test, and deploy Angular applications. It simplifies common development tasks and provides a consistent project structure.
Angular Components: Components are the building blocks of Angular applications. They encapsulate the application's UI and logic, making it easier to manage and reuse code.
Angular Modules: Angular applications are built using modular structures. Modules help organize the application into cohesive, functional units. They encapsulate related components, services, and other features.
Angular Directives: Directives are markers on a DOM element that tell Angular to attach a specific behavior to that element or transform the DOM.
Angular Services: Services are reusable, injectable objects that can be used to encapsulate shared business logic, data, or functionality across different parts of an application.
Angular Templates: Templates define the HTML views of Angular components. They use Angular-specific syntax to bind data and handle events.
Angular Forms: Angular provides a powerful and flexible forms module for handling user input. It includes features for validation, form controls, and reactive forms.
Angular Routing: Angular's routing module allows developers to implement navigation and define the structure of the application by configuring routes.
RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript): Angular heavily relies on RxJS for handling asynchronous operations, such as HTTP requests and event handling, in a reactive programming style.
Angular Material: A UI component library that provides pre-built, customizable components following the Material Design guidelines. It simplifies the creation of visually appealing and consistent user interfaces.
NgRx: A state management library for Angular applications, inspired by Redux. It helps manage the state of the application in a predictable way, especially in larger and more complex applications.
Angular Testing: Angular provides tools and utilities for writing unit tests, end-to-end tests, and integration tests to ensure the reliability and quality of the application.
